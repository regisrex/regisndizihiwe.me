    <T>About me! </T>

      <p className = 'mb-4' >
        I am a software developer, open source fanatic, a mentor and user experience designer. 
        </p>
          <p className = 'mb-4' >
            I & apos;m a full stack software developer & ux - designer with almost 3 years of experience.I & apos;m likely to be on the design or the backend team.
        I code in Typescript, Golang and a little bit of Java.
        </p>
    <p className = 'mb-4' >
      About libraries and frameworks, I use react, next.js on the frontend vue.js, node.js, express.js, nest.js on the backend.I also use gin and mux in the Golang ecosystem. 
        </p>
        <p className = 'mb-4' >
          When codes and designs feel boring that day, I engage into open source by building up some tools and packages or just contributing to what others have been doing.
        </p>
            <p className = 'mb-4' >
              I believe connecting and  building is a great way to expand the tech universe and that & apos;s why I & apos;m always looking for other people 
          with same interests as mines so that I can collaborate on projects and share skills with them.
        </p>
  <p className = 'mb-4' >
    Out of the world of programming, I enjoy arts and business.
