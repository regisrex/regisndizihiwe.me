        <p className='mb-4'>
          Sup there! I&apos;m Regis.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          I&apos;m a software developer, open source fanatic, tech advocate and user experience designer.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Professionally, I&apos;m a full stack software developer & ux-designer with almost 3 years of experience. I&apos;m likely to be on the design or the backend team.
          I code in Typescript, Golang and a little bit of Java.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          About libraries and frameworks, I use react, next.js on the frontend vue.js, node.js, express.js, nest.js on the backend. I also use gin and mux in the Golang ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          When codes and designs feel boring that day, I engage into open source by building up some tools and packages or just contributing to what others have been doing.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          I believe connecting and  building is a great way to expand the tech universe and that&apos;s why I&apos;m always looking for other people
          with same interests as mines so that I can collaborate on projects and share skills with them.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Out of the world of programming, I enjoy arts and business.
        </p>
