Later this week I was walking around in Github, searching for rust codebases and seeing what can be built with rust.
I came accross a project called [gcommit](https://github.com/veritem/gcommit), which had this fuctionality of helping you write better conventional commit messages.
I found thi interesting and as I was learning rust in those days, I folked it and coolified it ðŸ˜‰.

#### How the tool was before
It's only feature was just giving a dialog to fill in information about you commit once the user types `gcommit` in their terminal which is the one that attracted me to take my  spare time and add more features in this tool.
{/* ![Preview image, gcommit v0.0.3](https://github.com/veritem/gcommit/raw/main/assets/preview.png) */}
#### What I added 
First, I started by adding a feature of commiting in a single line. used a crate called `clap`  to  handle args and add this whole feature, It's a awesome tool, most rustaceans use it.
```bash 
>_ gcommit -c <type> -s <scope> -m <commit_message>
```
Next, I added a feature of configuring gcommit using a file so that development teams and open source  projects  can integrate `gcommit` in their workflow.
I decided to use yaml instead of json, mainly because yaml is lightweight and easy to write, just like making indented lists.
I also added a validation feature, which validates commit types and scopes based on the configurations.

When you type `gcommit` in terminal in your repo's base directory for the first time, it creates `.gcommit.yml` automatically with default  configurations.
```bash 
>_ gcommit
Found no .gcommit.yml, creating a default one...
```
The default configurations look like this:
```yml
# file-name: .gcommit.yml 
classes:
  feat:   A new feature
  fix:    A bug fix
  docs:   Documentation only changes
  style:  Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  perf:   A code change that improves performance
  test:   Adding missing tests
  chore:  Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

scopes:
  - web
  - api
  - docs
```
The default config is based on proper commit conventions accross the open source community.

#### Getting started with gcommit
The new version (v0.0.4) of gcommit is now released, you can  download a binary for your platform [here](https://github.com/veritem/gcommit/releases/tag/0.0.4)
After installation, type `gcommit --help` to get the cli help
```cmd
$ gcommit --help
Usage: gcommit.exe [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --class              Classification or type of commit
  -s, --scope              Project scope where changes were made
  -m, --message            Commit message
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version

```

#### Outro
Even if this tool might have sounded as something cool to you, it's not actively maintained currently, in fact, when i found it, its latest commit was in 2 years, 
for serious projects, I recommend using tools like [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) or [commitzen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/).
